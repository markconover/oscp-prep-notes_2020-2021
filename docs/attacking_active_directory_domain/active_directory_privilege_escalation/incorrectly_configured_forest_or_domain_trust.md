## Incorrectly configured Forest - or Domain trust
A forest consists of two or more domains.

The domain can have trust between each other. This means that a security principal (a user for example) can access a resource on the other domain. This might be intended. 

Previously the forest was viewed as a security boundry. So even though there was bi-directional trust between forests (so called *inter*-forest trust) it was not possible for admins in one forest to take over domain controllers in the other forests. Since the "printer-bug" (MS-RPRN) was discovered by Lee Christensen in 2018 this is not longer the case. This mean that if your organisation has a bi-directional trust with another forest, and that forest gets compromised, it is possible for an attacker to compromise your forest as well. 

### Type of trust / Direction of trust
The AD can have specific trust types. The types of trusts are the following:

- Parent/Child - 
- Cross-link
- External
- Tree-root
- Forest
- MIT


## Using Bloodhound

If there is trust between domains in a forrest, it might be that a user is allowed to retrevie 

You can just click on the default query "Map domain trusts"
```
MATCH p=(n:Domain)-->(m:Domain) RETURN p
```

## How to test for it

You can identify what types of trusts you have by running the following commands:

```
Get-NetForestDomain
Get-NetDomainTrust 
```


Get-ADObject -SearchBase "cn=system,dc=evilcorp,dc=se" -Filter * -Properties trustType | where {$_.objectClass â€“eq "trustedDomain"} | select Name,trustType
